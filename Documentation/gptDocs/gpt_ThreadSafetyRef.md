In C++20, you can use synchronization primitives like std::condition_variable and std::mutex to set up ready signals between threads. Here's a basic example of how you can achieve this:

### cpp
```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool ready = false;

void worker_thread() {
    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    
    // Notify the main thread that work is done
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        ready = true;
    }
    cv.notify_one();
}

int main() {
    std::thread worker(worker_thread);

    // Wait for the worker thread to finish its work
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        cv.wait(lock, []{ return ready; });
    }

    std::cout << "Worker thread finished its work." << std::endl;

    worker.join();
    
    return 0;
}

```
In this example, the main thread waits for the worker thread to finish its work. The worker thread sets the ready flag to true when it's done and then notifies the main thread using the condition variable cv. The main thread waits on the condition variable until the ready flag becomes true, at which point it proceeds.

Remember that synchronization between threads should be handled carefully to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Using std::condition_variable and std::mutex helps ensure safe communication and synchronization between threads.
